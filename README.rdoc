= options_for_select_with_attributes

== Usage
Works just like options_from_collection_for_select but allows you to pass in a hash of HTML attributes and methods.
  options_for_select_with_attributes(collection, value, label, attributes, selected=nil)

== Example
  form.select :user_id, options_for_select_with_attributes(User.all, :id, :name, { :class => :role }, current_user)
  
This will yield options with the class attribute set to user.role:
  <option value="1" class="admin">George Washington</option>
