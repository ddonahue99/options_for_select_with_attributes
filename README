Usage:

Works just like options_from_collection_for_select but allows you to pass in a hash of HTML attributes and methods.

options_for_select_with_attributes(collection, value, label, attributes, selected=nil)

Example:

form.select :user_id, options_for_select_with_attributes(User.all, :id, :name, { :class => :role }, current_user))

This will yield options with the class attribute set to user.role:

<option value="1" class="admin">George Washington</option>
